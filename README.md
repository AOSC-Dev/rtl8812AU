# rtl8812AU
This repository contains drivers for the rtl8812AU and rtl8821AU/rtl8811AU chipsets.

It started out because I found a newer driver then I found elsewhere, namely version 4.3.8.
But since then I found even newer versions released by Realtek and decided to use/update those too.

Currently there are the following branches, named after the initial Realtek driver version.
- [version 4.3.8](https://github.com/diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU/tree/driver-4.3.8)
- [version 4.3.14](https://github.com/diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU/tree/driver-4.3.14)
- [version 4.3.22-beta](https://github.com/diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU/tree/driver-4.3.22-beta)
